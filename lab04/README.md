## Part 1: Commit groups

For full details on the changes made during the course of this lab please check the commit history. In the commit history 5 commit groups are identified by message.

For the first commit group, I created a test that checks the fizzbuzz converter given a null value. I made it fail and then pass. To refactor my code I decided not to append values to the result variable but set it to a value only once.

For the second commit group, I created a test that checks the fizzbuzz converter given a 0 value. I made it fail and then pass. To refactor my code I decided not to use a result value but immedietly return what is expected

For the third commit group, I created a test that checks the fizzbuzz converter given a 6 value to get the Fizz value. I made it fail and then pass. To refactor my code I decided to make the null check be an if statement in the beginning the stops the code there just to make the code look neater.

For the fourth commit group, I created a test that checks the fizzbuzz converter given a 7 value to get the normal value. I made it fail and then pass. To refactor my code I decided to make helper methods that check if something is divisble by 3 or 5

For the fifth commit group, I created a test that checks the Massfizzbuzzconverter given a length of 20. I made it fail and then pass. To refactor my code I decided to seperate the null value and above 0 value checkers to the exceptions can be clearer in the future
